## **3. Interactive Debugging Tool** 

#### Create a time slider

In this question, I create a slider using ipywidgets to dynamically show the position of the shots in different 20 seconds of the game, to see if there is any relationship between the period of the game and the shot position.

##### Data processing

Aim for speeding up, I firstly choose data of team Montréal Canadiens to reduce data a little bit. Then I add a new column named TimeinSecond which is just int type seconds of the original "MM:SS" string type of time.

```python
data=pd.read_csv("data.csv")
montreal=data[data["team.name"]=="Montréal Canadiens"]
def get_sec(time_str):
    m, s = time_str.split(':')
    return 3600 + int(m) * 60 + int(s)
second=[]
for time in montreal["about.periodTime"]:
    second.append(get_sec(time))
montreal['TimeinSecond']=second
```

##### Create the plot

I combine a variable time with the slider, and draw a scatter plot depending on which 20 second the slider bar gives.

```python
def positionWithTime(time=20):
    filtered=montreal.loc[(montreal['TimeinSecond'] >= time-20) & (montreal['TimeinSecond'] <= time)]
    fix,ax=plt.subplots(figsize=(16,10))
    filtered.plot(kind='scatter',
                         x='coordinates.x',
                         y='coordinates.y',
                         ax=ax);
import ipywidgets as widgets
widgets.interact(positionWithTime,time=(20,1200))
```

- Result and analysis

![q3](/ift6758-blog/images/q3.png)

The position of the shots of some 20 second of the game is showed above. While I toggle the slider bar and observe. Honestly speaking, I didn't see much relevance between the time period and the position of the shots.
